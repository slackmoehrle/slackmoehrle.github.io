# Light sources

__Light source__ in game development represents a light-emitting object that can illuminate the surrounding environment

## Physically Based Lighting
__Cocos Creator 3D__ uses optical measurement units to describe light source parameters. Based on optical measurement units, we can convert all relevant parameters of the light source into physical values in the real world. In this way, the designer can adjust the __light intensity__, __color__, __range__ and __other__ parameters according to the industrial standards of parameters and the physical parameters of a real environment. The overall lighting effect is more in line with the real natural environment.

__Cocos Creator 3D__ supports three types of light sources:
- [Directional Light](light/dir-light.md)
- [Spherical Light](light/sphere-light.md)
- [Spotlights](light/spot-light.md)
