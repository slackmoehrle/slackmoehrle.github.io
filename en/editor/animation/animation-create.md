# Create Animation components and animation clips

## Creating Animation Components

On each __Node__, we can add different __components__. If we want to create an __animation__ on this node, we must also create a new __Animation component__ for it.

There are two ways to create a new __Animation component__:

 - Select the corresponding node, click __Add Component__ below in the __Property Inspector__, and select __Animation Component__ in __Components__.
 - Open the animation editor, then select the node in which to add then animation in the __Hierarchy Manager__, and click the __Add Animation component__ button in the animation editor.

Specifics about __Animation component__ parameters can be found in [Animation Component Reference](./../../engine/animation/animation-component.md) documentation.

## Creating and mounting animation clips

Even though there is an __Animation component__ on the __Node__, there is no corresponding __animation clip data__. There are two ways to create __animation clips__:

  - Click the `+` on the upper left in the __Assets manager__, or right-click the blank area and select __Animation Clip__. Now, a clip file named 'New AnimationClip' will be created in the __Assets manager__.

It is not enough to just create it. We need to click on the node, in the __Hierachy manager__ and find __Animation__ in the __Property Inspector__. At this time, __Clips__ shows __0__, and it needs to be changed to __1__. __Next__, drag the __New AnimationClip__ that was just created in the __Assets Manager__, and drag it into the __animation-clip selection box__ that just appeared.

  - If you have not added an __animation clip file__ in the __Animation component__, you can directly click the __New AnimationClip__ button in the animation editor to create a new animation clip file. The newly created animation clip will be automatically attached to the animation component.

> **Note**: If you choose to overwrite the existing clip file, the content of the overwritten file will be cleared.

So far, we have completed the preparations before the animation, the next step is to edit the [animation sequences](animation-clip.md).
