# Explorer

The **Asset Manager** panel is an important tool used to access and manage project assets. When starting to make a game, **importing assets** is usually a necessary step. You can use the __Hello World__ template project as a starting point when creating a new project. After you create and open a new project, various types of assets are visible in the **Explorer** panel.

## Explorer Panel introduction

The **Explorer** panel is the main panel. It has a *heads-up menu area*, *a central tree list area*, and a *bottom information display area*.

- The functions of the *heads-up menu area* are: *New asset button*, *Sort by button*, *Search type button*, *Search box*, *Fold or expand all button*, and *Refresh list button*
- The *central tree list area* mainly reflects the hierarchical relationship of assets. The root node is the asset root folder corresponding to the file manager of the operating system. The editor calls an __asset database__ *(DB for short)*, and is located in the project folder. It belongs to the project asset; __Internal DB__ comes with the editor and provides some built-in necessary assets. It is a **read-only** asset. It cannot be *added*, *deleted*, *modified*, but **can** be *directly referenced* or *copied*.
- The *bottom display area* is the URL of the asset after the asset is selected, such as `db://assets`
- The __right-click__ menu of the panel is also an important function. The contents of the __right-click__ menu in different locations are different, and the unavailable menus are grayed out.
- The shortcut of the panel currently supports the operation of assets:

    - **Copy**: Ctrl or Cmd + C
    - **Paste**: Ctrl or Cmd + V
    - **Copy**: Ctrl or Cmd + D, Ctrl + drag asset
    - **Delete**: Delete
    - **Up and down selection**: up and down arrows
    - **Folder folding**: left arrow or Backspace
    - **Expand the folder**: right arrow or Enter
    - **Multi-select**: Ctrl or Cmd + click
    - **Multi-select**: Shift + click
    - **Rename**: Enter/F2
    - **Cancel Rename**: Esc

## New assets

__Click__ the **New Asset button** when adding a asset. An **input box** will appear. The name of the asset is required. If the input is empty, the asset will not be created. If there is no selected item in the tree list, it will be newly created on the root node of `Asset DB` by default; if there are multiple selected items, it will be newly created in the first selected item at this time.

In addition, there is a **New** entry in the __right-click__ menu of the folder.

## Selecting an asset

In the __Asset List__, you can use the following operations to select assets:

- The __up__ and __down__ arrows on the keyboard can be used to select.
- Hold down __Ctrl__ or __Cmd + click__ to select multiple assets.

## Moving an asset

The assets are moved by dragging the tree nodes:

- **Move the asset**: the asset is dragged from one folder in the tree list to another folder. An orange frame will indicate the range of the folder to which the new location belongs.
- **Drag out assets**: you can drag *.prefab*, *.gltf*, *.mesh*, *.fbx* assets to the **Scene Panel** or the **Hierarchy Manager** to generate nodes.
- **Drag the asset**: drag the node from the **Explorer Panel** to a folder in the list. You can save the node as a `.prefab` asset. Please see the[Prefab Asset](../../asset/prefab.md) documentation. From the file manager of the **operating system**, drag the file to the list to realize the asset import.
