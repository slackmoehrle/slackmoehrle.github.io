# Editor interface introduction

This chapter will introduce the __editor interface__, familiarize developers with the various panels, menus and buttons that make up the __editor__. The __Cocos Creator 3D__ __editor__ consists of multiple panels, which can be freely moved and customized to suit the needs of different projects and the preferences of developers. The default editor layout will be used as an example to quickly browse the names and functions of the various panels:

## Scene Editor

The **Scene Editor** is a working area for displaying and editing visual content in a __Scene__. The WYSIWYG scene construction work is completed by the display in the __Scene Editor__.

For details, please read the [Scene Editor](scene/index.md) documentation.

## Hierarchy Manager

The **Hierarchy Manager** shows all the nodes in the __Scene__ and their hierarchical relationship is displayed in the form of a __tree view__. All the content in the __Scene Editor__ can be found in the corresponding node entry in the __Hierarchy Manager__. The contents of the two panels will be displayed simultaneously. Generally, we will also use these two panels to build the __Scene__ at the same time.

For more details, please read the [Hierarchy Manager](hierarchy/index.md) documentation.

## Asset Panel

The **Asset Panel** displays all assets in the project asset folder (assets). Here the folders will be displayed in a tree structure and the changes to the contents of the project asset folder in the operating system will be automatically synchronized. You can drag and drop files directly from outside the project, or use the menu to import assets.

For details, please read the [asset Manager] (assets / index.md) section.
