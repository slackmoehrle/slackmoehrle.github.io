# Build Process with FAQ

The build process is mainly divided into two parts, the **General Build Process** and the **Platform Adaptation Process**. The adaptation processing logic for each platform will be embedded in the **Build** panel as a separate plugin. The build plugin system is then open and developers can dynamically embed some build parameters into the panel for use.

## General build Process

The general build process for **Cocos Creator 3D** consists of the following:

1. Initialization of build parameters
2. Prepare build data
3. Write the built asset to the file system
4. Organizing the data of `settings`
5. Compression and writing of `settings uuid`

### Initialization of build parameters

This step mainly initializes the initial `options` passed to the build to the internal `options` of the build, does some parameter formatting, initializes the asset data of the build asset database, loads the latest asset information, and classifies it.

### Prepare build data

The editor will first summarize the scene currently involved in the build and all assets in the `resources` directory. Each asset is packaged through the engine's deserialization process to find the dependent asset and recursion to pack the assets. The entire project's scripting environment is configured before being deserialized, that is, all non-plugin project scripts are loaded. Because whether the script loads correctly or not directly affects the deserialization, failure to load because the script is not written legally will directly result in build failure. If the dependent asset is lost in the deserialization process, a warning is issued, but the build continues nonetheless. The warning here does not mean that the problem does not need to be resolved, and if the asset loss is not resolved, it is difficult to guarantee that the problem will not occur after the build.

This step will also sort out the asset types based on the build's internal division, such as scenes, scripts, texture compression tasks, JSON grouping information, etc., and weed out asset information that is not used. 

> **Note**: All user scripts are loaded before this step is performed.

### Write the built asset to the file system

After performing the previous steps, then we need to generate the used assets into the file system. After building, the serialized JSON files of all assets are placed in the `res/import` directory. The original files of all assets are placed in the `res/raw-assets` directory. The build process can be broken down into the following phases:

1. **Build scripts**: The scripts in the editor are divided into **plugin scripts** and **non-plugin scripts**.

    - The plugin script will copy the source file to the `build/src` directory, which is generated after the build based on the original directory structure. The plugin script does not support any script that needs to be compiled, such as **TS** or **JS written in ES6**. The asset information of the plugin script is written to the `jsList` array in `settings`.

    - The non-plugin script will package the source files into `project.js` (`project.dev.js` in debug mode) in the corresponding `src` directory. Checking the `sourceMap` option will generate a corresponding `map` file, and the `debug` option will determine whether the script is compressed or not.

2. **Auto Atlas**: Query all **Auto Altas** assets in the project, and then pack **SpriteFrame** assets within **Auto Altas** into a big **Sprite Atlas** assets, serialize assets to `JSON` according to the configuration of **Auto Atlas** assets. This step will  modify the JSON grouping information, asset asset grouping information and add texture compression task. If the **packAutoAtlas** option in the **Build** panel is not checked during the build, no processing is done.

3. **Compress Texture**: Compress the texture assets according to the organized texture compression tasks and write them to the folder generated after build. If the **Compress Texture** option in the **Build** panel is not checked during the build, no processing is done.

4. **Build engine**: Follow the settings in the menu bar **Project -> Project Setting -> Modules** to discard the unused engine modules, and package them into the `src/cocos3d.js` file. Checking the sourceMap option will generate a corresponding `map` file. Checking the **debug** option will determine whether the script is compressed or not.

    The main steps in building the engine are as follows:

    - Get the engine module information in the menu bar **Project -> Project Setting -> Modules**.

    - Check if the engine version in the cache is the same as the engine version that needs to be compiled, and if it is, copy it without compiling.

    - If compilation is required, perform the task of packaging the engine according to the engine interface. Copy the compiled `js` file and save the engine's modification time.

    When compiling the engine, you can view the output log information. Please refer to the [log information](./build-panel.md) documentation for the detail log viewing method.

    ![build-engine](./build-guide/build-engine.jpg)

    Rules for reusing engine files: The packaged engine files will be placed in the `bin/.cache/.editor-cache` directory of the engine, according to the hash values generated by the parameters that affect the engine compilation. And the `.watch-file.json` file contains the modification times for the individual engine files.

    ```bash
    engine-folder
    |--bin
        |--.cache
            |--.editor-cache
                |-- 1dc4a547f9...63a43bb8965.watch-files.json
                |-- 1dc4a547f9...63a43bb8965
                |-- 1dc4a547f9...63a43bb8965.map
                ...
    ```

    As soon as any of the engine's build options change, the engine will recompile. Specifically affecting the engine build are:

    - debug: Whether in debug mode
    - includeModules: Setting engine modules
    - sourceMaps: Whether or not to enable `sourceMap`
    - platform: Build platform
    - the modification times for the engine files.

5. **build JSON**: Serialized JSON is merged based on the JSON grouping and written to the file system (placed in the `res/import` directory). If in release mode, compression is also performed on the `uuid` in the serialized JSON.

6. **General assets copy**: Some of the original assets (rawAssets) in the `library` are copied directly into the `res/raw-assets` folder generated after the build.

7. **MD5 Cache**: Add the MD5 suffix to all the assets in the `res` folder and organize the data to record in `settings`.

8. **Generate `main.js` template file**: Configure project settings into the `main.js` folder according to the the developers specified options. Generate them in the build output directory.

### Organizing the data of `settings`

The main thing is to prepare the necessary configuration information for the game start based on the data of previous asset collation.

About the structure of settings:

```js
{
    debug: boolean; // Whether in debug mode
    designResolution: { // Canvas resolution
        width: number; // The width of canvas resolution
        height: number; // The height of canvas resolution
        policy: number; // Full screen aspect adapted mode
    };
    launchScene: string; // URL of the initial scene
    platform: string; // Platform
    rawAssets: { [index: string]: { [uuid: string]: string[] } };
    // Store the asset URL and type loaded in assets
    // Example: "bba00d3a-2f17-4511-b47c-0d584b21b763@6c48a": ["test/right/texture", "cc.Texture2D", "bba0...@6c48a"]
    // "bba0...@6c48a": ["test/right/texture", 1, 1]
    scenes: Array<{url: string, uuid: string}>; // The array of scenes information involved in the run
    scriptPackages: Array<{moduleId: string, file: string}>; // Script message array
    jsList: string[]; // Script plugin array
    moduleIds: string[]; // Information on all user script components
    packedAssets: Record<string, IUuid[] | number[]>; // json grouping information
    md5AssetsMap: { [index: string]: Array<string | number> }; // It is not available until md5Cache is checked, and the array is stored in the format of [uuid_1, md5_1, uuid_2, md5_2, ...]. If uuid_1 is a simple number, it means that the uuid index in the uuids array is stored.
    uuids: string[]; // Arrays of uuid, only takes effect in release mode
    assetTypes?: string[]; // Arrays of asset types, only takes effect in release mode
    subpackages?: Record<IUuid, IPackageInfo>; // Subpackage asset information
    renderPipeline: string; // renderPipeline information
}
```

The structure here only lists the settings structure under the general build process, and actually adds configurations as needed when packaging for different platforms.

### Compression and writing of `settings uuid`

During the asset packaging process, the `uuid` of all assets involved in the build are continuously collected and then organized into `setting.js`. `setting.js` will be written to the `build/src` directory, which isgenerated after the build. The `uuid` in the file will be compressed or not, depending on whether it is in debug mode or not. Organize all used `uuid` and store the `uuid` that appear more than twice in the `uuids` array, and replaced with indexes. All `assetType` that appear more than twice are also stored in the `assetTypes` array, and replaced with indexes.

#### Build assets

At this stage, the editor will arrage the **scenes assets that selected in Build panel and all assets in the assets directory. All assets will be deserialized by engine to find out the dependent assets in deep**. Before deserialization, editor will load all the scriptsï¼ˆexpect plugin scripts) in the project, if the script is written illegally and fails to load, it will make this build task stop immediately. If any dependent asset is missing during the deserialization process, a warning info will be print, but editor will continue to build. When warning info is printed, we recommend you to read and try to resolve it, otherwise it may cause some unexpect errors after build. During the packaging process, the assets will be re-compressed and serialized after deserialization to reduce the package size. Also, all serialized files will be sorted into deferent `JSON` groups to reduce the size of game package.

Assets that perform deserialization during the packing process will recompress the serialization to reduce the package size after packing. The serialized files of the texture assets are all packaged into a single `JSON` file, and the other serialized files are subpackaged according to the build options configuration.

#### Build scripts

The scripts in the editor are divided into **plugin script** and **non-plugin script**.

- The plugin script will copy the source file to the `build/src` directory generated after the build based on the original directory structure, so the plugin script does not support any script that needs to be compiled, such as **TS** or **JS written in ES6**. The asset information of the plugin script is written to the `jsList` array in `settings`.

- The non-plugin script will package the source files into `project.js` (`project.dev.js` in debug mode) in the corresponding `src` directory.

## Platform Adaptation Process

The build provides a partial lifecycle hook function that facilitates the developer's involvement in the build during the different processing periods of the build. The build also provides a way for developers to add build options directly, as well as to modify the UI interface of the build panel, data verification, etc. At the moment these features are not open to the public, only briefly described here, but the platform building plugins within the editor have been developed in this way.

## Frequently asked questions

The entire build process is in a separate `worker`, so if you want to see the log information during the build, please refer to the [Build Log](./build-panel.md).

Please make sure that the scenes involved in the build can be previewed properly before the build, some of the scenes asset loss, script compilation failure problems can be exposed in the preview stage. Building on the premise of a normal preview allows for better troubleshooting and saves time.

### Assets loading with a 404

In this case, please copy the `uuid` in the lost asset error message to **Assets** to find the corresponding asset, and then see if all the assets on which the asset depends are normal.

Assets loading with a 404 usually occurs in the following situations:

1. **Assets that are not in `resources` are dynamically loaded in the script**

    - **Reason**: Only the assets in the `resources` directory and those involved in building the scene will be packaged into the final release package. And only the asset `url` in the `resources` directory will be written to `settings.js`, if an asset is used in the script but not in the `resources` directory, then a 404 will appear when it is loaded.

    - **Solution**: Move the used assets to the `resources` directory.

2. **The loaded asset had a problem when it was imported, causing the data to not be generated properly into the `library`**

    - **Reason**: All raw data during the build is obtained by reading the asset file in the `library`, and if the import fails, the correct corresponding asset information will not be obtained.

    - **Solution**: Find the corresponding asset through **Assets** panel, right click it, and select **Reimport Asset** in the menu.

3. **Lost assets**

    - **Reason**: asset builds look for dependencies through engine deserialization, and the most frequent problem is that the dependent asset is accidentally deleted during the project iteration, resulting in the loss of the asset. The loss of these assets may not normally be noticed, but will be exposed once the build is executed.

    - **Solution**: Use the Code Editor to find out which assets the `uuid` is referenced by, and then modify the corresponding assets.

### Script asset load error  

The scripting environment needs to be configured for the build. If the error message is related to the script, please refer to the error message to modify the script. If it is not clear which script is reporting the error, you can find the `uuid` of the corresponding script in the error message's call stack, and then look for the location in **Assets**.

### Find the image merged from Auto Atlas

The Auto Atlas prints the `uuid` information of the original small image and the merged large image during the build process, the `uuid` can be found in the Build devTools, then the large image can be found by searching in the `res/raw-assets` folder generated after the build using the `uuid` of the found large image. If there are too many images, you can search for `uuid` directly in the build log.

### Engine compilation failed.

If it's a custom engine compilation failure, check your modified code, or custom engine path.
