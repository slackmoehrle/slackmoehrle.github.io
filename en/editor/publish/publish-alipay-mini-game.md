## Resource Management for Alipay Mini Game Environment

**Alipay Mini Game** is similar to **WeChat Mini Game**. There are restrictions on the package size. Assets more than **4MB** must be downloaded via a network request.

It is recommended to only save script files in the mini-game packages, while other assets are uploaded to the remote server, and downloaded from the remote server as needed. The download, cache, and version management of remote assets, **Cocos Creator 3D** has already done it for you. The specific implementation logic is similar to the **WeChat Mini Game**. Please refer to the [Resource Management for WeChat Mini Game Environment](./publish-wechatgame.md) documentation for details.

Specifically, developers need to:

  1. Set the **Remote URL** in the **Build** panel. And then click **Build**.
  2. When the build is complete, upload the `build/alipay-mini-game/res` folder to the server.
  3. Delete the `res` folder under the local release package directory.
