# Animation overview

__Cocos Creator 3D__ has a built-in general animation system to realize animation based on key frames.

__Animation Clips__ are assets that contain animation information. __Animation Clips__ can be reused, and their state is saved in an object called an __Animation State__.
__Animation State__ can *play*, *pause*, *stop*, and *change* the animation.

The __Animation Component__ manages __Animation Clips__ and their states in a unified manner, allowing users to implement animation functions at the component level.

In the editor, one can easily produce animation clip assets. For example, through the __Animation Editor__, or using external assets already containing __Animation Clip__ assets.

The [__Animation Components__](./animation-component.md) documentation describes how to use __Animation Components__ and __Animation Clips__ to control the playback of animations.

The [__Animation Clip__](./animation-clip.md) documentation describes the composition of _Animation Clips__ or creating _Animation Clips__ programmatically.

The [__Skeletal Animation__](./skeletal-animation.md) documentation describes how to use this common but special type of animation.
