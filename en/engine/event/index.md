## Event

**Events** are a messaging mechanism used for object interaction within the engine.

#### Event monitoring

```ts
// The event listener will be triggered every time, you need to 
// manually cancel the registration
xxx.on(type, func, target);
```

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| *type* | the event registration string. |
| *func* | the callback for performing event monitoring. | 
| *target* | the event receiving object. |

#### Event cancellation

```ts
// Cancel all registered events of this type on the object
xxx.off(type);
// Cancel the event of the specified target of the specified 
// callback on the object
xxx.off(type, func, target);
```

#### Event distribution

```ts
// Dispatch parameters can be specified when the event 
// is dispatched
xxx.emit(type, ...arg);
```

> **Note**: due to the performance considerations of the underlying event dispatch, only a maximum of 5 event parameters are supported here. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the number of control parameters when passing parameters.

## Event descriptions

### System events

*System events* refer to global events, which are monitored and distributed directly from the browser.

```ts
cc.systemEvent.on(type, func, target);
```

Currently supported system events are: *touch events*, *mouse events*, *gravity events*, and *key press events*. The global event type can be ontained by using `cc.SystemEventType`.

| Event Name | Event Type Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| *TOUCH_START* | Finger starts touch event. |
| *TOUCH_MOVE* | When your finger moves on the screen. |
| *TOUCH_END* | The finger ends the touch event. |
| *TOUCH_CANCEL* | When the finger leaves the screen outside the target node area. |
| *MOUSE_DOWN* | Triggered once when the mouse is pressed. |
| *MOUSE_MOVE* | When the mouse moves on the target node in the target node area, whether it is pressed or not. |
| *MOUSE_UP* | Triggered once when the mouse is released from the pressed state. |
| *MOUSE_WHEEL* | Mouse scroll event. |
| *MOUSE_ENTER* | When the mouse moves into the target node area, whether it is pressed or not. |
| *MOUSE_EXIT* | When the mouse moves out of the target node area, whether it is pressed or not. |
| *KEY_DOWN* | Event triggered when a key is pressed. |
| *KEY_UP* | Event triggered when the key is released. |
| *DEVICEMOTION* | Gravity sensing. |

The key value list obtained by the `KEY` event can be used by referring to the API `Macro`.

### UI events

**Event processing** is done in the node. For components, you can register and listen to events by accessing the node this.node. Monitoring events can be registered using the `this.node.on()` function as follows:

```ts
import { _decorator, Component, Node } from "Cocos3D";
const { ccclass } = _decorator;

@ccclass("example")
export class example extends Component {
    onLoad() {
      this.node.on(Node.EventType.TOUCH_CANCEL, this.callback, this);
    }

    callback(){

    }

    onDestroy(){
      // In general, for data recovery control, we will 
      // specify func, and cancel the event when the component 
      // is destroyed
      this.node.off(Node.EventType.TOUCH_CANCEL);
    }
```

| Event Name | Event Type Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| *TRANSFORM_CHANGED* | Node change position, rotation or zoom event. |
| *POSITION_PART* | Node position change event. Unified monitoring by __TRANSFORM_CHANGED__, and judge the type after distribution. |
| *ROTATION_PART* | Node rotation event. Unified monitoring by __TRANSFORM_CHANGED__, and judge the type after distribution. |
| *SCALE_PART* | Node zoom event. Unified monitoring by __TRANSFORM_CHANGED__, and judge the type after distribution. |
| *SIZE_CHANGED* | Event triggered when the node size changes. |
| *ANCHOR_CHANGED* | Event triggered when the node anchor changes. |
| *CHILD_ADDED* | Node subclass added. |
| *CHILD_REMOVED* | Node subclasses removed. |
