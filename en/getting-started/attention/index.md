## Precautions

### Syntax format

__Cocos Creator 3D__  and __Cocos Creator__ use a different syntax format. 

__Cocos Creator 3D__ has full support for __ES6__ and __TypeScript__. Therefore, __Cocos Creator 3D__ only supports __ES6__ and __TypeScript__ `classes`. In addition, we also support __TypeScript__ syntax hints. 

__Cocos Creator__ supports only __ES5__ `classes`. 

__Please keep this precaution in mind.__
