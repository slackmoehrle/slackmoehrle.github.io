# YAML 101
The parser used conforms to YAML 1.2 standard, this means full JSON compatibility, you can write JSON directly if you want to:

```yaml
"techniques":
  [{
    "passes":
    [{
      "vert": "skybox-vs",
      "frag": "skybox-fs",
      "rasterizerState":
      {
        "cullMode": "none"
      }
      # ... hash sign for comments
    }]
  }]
```

But of course it would be cumbersome and error-prone, so what YAML provides is a much simpler representation of the same data:<br>
(you can always refer to any [online YAML JSON converter](https://codebeautify.org/yaml-to-json-xml-csv) to play around ideas)

* All quotation marks and commas can be omitted (but note, **never omit the space after colon**)

```yaml
key1: 1
key2: unquoted string
```

* Like python, indentation is part of the syntax, representing hierarchy of the data<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

```yaml
object1:
  key1: false
object2:
  key2: 3.14
  key3: 0xdeadbeef
  nestedObject:
    key4: 'quoted string'
```

* Array elements are represented by dash+space prefix

```yaml
- 42
- "double-quoted string"
- arrayElement3:
    key1: punctuations? sure.
    key2: you can even have {}s as long as they are not the first character
    key3: { nested1: 'but no unquoted string allowed inside brackets', nested2: 'also notice the comma is back too' }
```

With these in mind, the effect manifest at the beginning of this document can be re-write as follows:

```yaml
techniques:
- passes:
  - vert: skybox-vs
    frag: skybox-fs
    rasterizerState:
      cullMode: none
    # ...
```

Another YAML feature that might comes in handy is reference and inheritance. Take a look at reference first:

```yaml
object1: &o1
  key1: value1
object2:
  key2: value2
  key3: *o1
```

This is its corresponding JSON:

```json
{
  "object1": {
    "key1": "value1"
  },
  "object2": {
    "key2": "value2",
    "key3": {
      "key1": "value1"
    }
  }
}
```

Next, inheritance:

```yaml
object1: &o1
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
object2:
  <<: *o1
  key3: value3
```

The corresponding JSON:

```json
{
  "object1": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  },
  "object2": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    "key3": "value3"
  }
}
```

For our purposes, like when multiple pass has the same properties, etc. it could be really helpful:

```yaml
techniques:
- passes:
  - # pass 1 specifications...
    properties: &props # declare once...
      p1: { value: [ 1, 1, 1, 1 ] }
      p2: { sampler: { mipFilter: linear } }
      p3: { inspector: { type: color } }
  - # pass 2 specifications...
    properties: *props # reference anywhere
```

Finally, before writing any YAML, wrap it in a CCEffect block first:
```yaml
CCEffect %{
  # YAML starts here
}%
```

<b id="f1">[1]</b> The YAML standard doesn't support tabs, so the effect compiler will try to replace all the tabs in file with 2 spaces first, to avoid the trivial yet annoying trouble of accidentally inserting tabs somewhere. But overall, please try to avoid doing that completely to make sure the compilation goes smoothly. [â†©](#a1)<br>
