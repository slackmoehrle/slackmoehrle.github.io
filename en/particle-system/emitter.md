Properties | Features
---|---
**shapeType** | Box
**emitFrom** | From which part of the block the particles are emitted, **edge**: border; **shell**: surface; **volume**: inside

- **Shpere\Hemisphere)**

![](particle-system/sphere_emitter.png)

Properties | Features
---|---
**shapeType** | Shpere\Hemisphere
**radius** | Sphere radius
**radiusThickness** | 0 means launch from the surface of the ball, 1 means launch from the inside of the sphere, and 0 ~ 1 means launch from the surface to the center of the sphere

- **Circle**

![](particle-system/circle_emitter.png)

Properties | Features
---|---
**shapeType** | Circle
**radius** | Radius of circle
**radiusThickness** | 0 means launching from the circle, 1 means launching from inside the circle, and 0 ~ 1 means launching from the circle to the center of the circle.
**arc** | Represents emission in a sector of the circle.
**mode** | Represents the emission method of particles in the fan-shaped area, **random**: random position, **loop**: cyclic emission in a certain direction, the same direction every time, **pingPong**: cyclic emission, every time On the contrary **spread**: indicates that the particles are emitted at a certain interval, for example, 0 indicates that they can be emitted at any position, and 0.1 indicates that they are emitted every tenth of the circumference.
**speed** | Represents the speed of particles emitted along the circumference.
**spread** | It indicates where the particles are emitted in the arc when they are emitted along the circumference. For example, if arc is 120째 and spread is 0.1, particles will be emitted every 12째 from the arc.

**angle** | Angle between cone axis and generatrix.
**radius** | Radius of the top of the cone.
**length** | The axial length of the top section of the cone from the bottom.
**radiusThickness** | 0 means launching from the circle, 1 means launching from inside the circle, and 0 ~ 1 means launching from the circle to the center of the circle.
**arc** | Represents emission in a sector of the circle.
