Properties | Features
--|--
duration|Total running time of particle system.
capacity|The maximum number of particles that a particle system can generate.
loop|Whether the particle system loops.
playOnAwake|Whether the particle system automatically starts playing after loading.
prewarm|After being selected, the particle system will start playing after one round has been played (only valid when loop playback is enabled).
simulationSpace|Control the coordinate system where the particle coordinates are calculated.
startDelay|Delay time of particle emission.
startLifetime|The life cycle of particle.
startColor|The initial color of particle.
scaleSpace|Coordinate space for particle scaling, **local** based on local space scaling, **world** based on world space scaling.
startSize|The initial size of particle.
startSpeed|The initial velocity of particle.
startRotation|The initial rotation angle of particle.
gravityModifier|Gravity coefficient.
rateOverTime|Number of particles emitted per second.
rateOverDistance|Number of particles emitted per moving unit distance.
bursts|Emit a given number of particles at a certain point in time
- time|How long does the particle play after it starts to emit burst.
- count|Number of particles emitted.
- repeatCount|The number of burst triggers.
- repeatInterval|The time interval of each trigger.
