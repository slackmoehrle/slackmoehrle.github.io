# Groups And Masks

In __Cocos Creator 3D__, some physics components (there are currently __rigid body components__ and __collider components__) provide interfaces for __Groups and Masks__.

## How does it work?

Physics elements and nodes are currently in a one-to-one relationship. The group and mask belong to the physics elements. The physics components on a single node modify the group and mask of the physics elements corresponding to the nodes.

As long as the following conditions are __true__, it will be detected

```ts
(GroupA & MaskB) && (GroupB & MaskA)
```

__For example__: two physical elements `A` and `B`.

The group value of `A` is `1` and the mask value is `3`

The group value of `B` is `2`, and the mask value is `2`

The formula `(1 & 2) && (2 & 3)` is __false__, so here `A` will not be detected with `B`.

Here according to the mask value of `B` is `2`, we can know that the detectable group of `B` is `1`, and the group of `A` is `0`, so it is not detected.

> **Note**: The expression depends on bit operation, the bit operation of `javascript` is limited to `32` bits, and the last bit is the sign bit. To avoid exceeding the operation range, it is recommended that the range of the group is `[0, 31 )`.

## Groups

### Setting a Group Value
The following group value is `3`, and the binary value is `11`, which means it is in the `0`, `1` group (starting from `0`)

```ts
const group = (1 << 0) + (1 << 1);
Collider.setGroup(group);
```

### Obtaining a Group Value
Use `getGroup()`.

```ts
Collider.getGroup();
```

### Adding a Group
Based on the above code, after the following code, the grouping value is `7`, and the binary value is `111`, so it means that it is in the `0`, `1`, and `2` groups.

```ts
const group = 1 << 2;
Collider.addGroup(group);
```

### Removing a Group
Based on the above code, after the following code, the grouping value is `3`, so in the `0`, `1` group.

```ts
const group = 1 << 2;
Collider.removeGroup(group);
```

> **Note**: It is recommended to fix in a group, you can use the node's `layer` property as a group.

> **Note**: The receiving parameters of the above methods are all decimal numbers. For easy understanding, binary explanation is used here. Developers can also directly input decimal numbers for group operation after they are familiar**.

## Masks

### Setting a Mask Value
The value of the following mask is `3`, the binary value is `11`, indicating that the detectable group is `0`, `1`.

```ts
const mask = (1 << 0) + (1 << 1);
Collider.setMask(mask);
```

### Obtaining a Mask Value
Use `getMask()`

```ts
console.log(Collider.getMask());
```

### Adding a Mask
  On the basis of the above code, after the following code, a detectable group `3` was added.

```ts
const mask = 1 << 2;
Collider.addMask(mask);
```

### Removing a Mask
  The following code removes a detectable group `3`.

```ts
const mask = 1 << 2;
Collider.removeMask(mask);
```

> **Note**: The addition and subtraction operation have higher priority than the shift operation.

> **Note**: Flexible use of group and mask can reduce the cost of additional detecting.

> **Note**: The group and mask of the physics system may continue to use the `Layer` property of `Node` and provide a setting panel, please pay attention to the update announcement.

## Examples

Here is a simple example of usage:

### Defining a Group

**Method 1**: Defined in an `object`

```ts
export const PHY_GROUP = {
    Group0: 1 << 0, // Group 0 is equivalent to giving it an alias of Group0.
    Group1: 1 << 1
};
```

**Method 2**: Defined in an `enum` (`typescript only`)

```ts
enum PHY_GROUP {
    Group0 = 1 << 0,
    Group1 = 1 << 1
};
```

> **Note**: You can consider to reuse the preset layers in `Layer`.

In order to be able to set up groups on the panel, you need to register the defined groups to the editor `Enum(PHY_GROUP)` through the `Enum` function exported by the `cc` module.

> **Note**: For historical reasons, the `Enum` function has special treatment for `-1`. If you are not familiar with it, do not define an attribute with a value of `-1`.

### Using a Mask

The mask can be defined according to grouping, for example:

- Define a mask(`const maskForGroup1 = PHY_GROUP.Group1;`) that only detects `Group1` 
- Define a mask(`const maskForGroup01 = PHY_GROUP.Group0 + PHY_GROUP.Group1;`) that can detect `Group0` and `Group1` 
- Define a mask(`const maskForNone = 0;`) that is not detected by all groups 
- Define a mask(`const maskForAll = -1;`) for all groups to detect 

### View Binary

By executing `(value >>> 0).toString(2)` in the running environment of JavaScript, you can see the binary string representation.
