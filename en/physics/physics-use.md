# Using Physics

In order to introduce how to use physics better, the following modules will be introduced:

Module | Description
---|---
[**Collision Component**](physics-collider.md) | Introduces the design of the `Collider` component and its relationship with the `RigidBody` component
[**Physics Material**](physics-material.md) | Introduced physics material assets in **Cocos Creator 3D**
[**Rigid Body Component**](physics-rigidbody.md) | Introduces some code usage examples of the `RigidBody` component
[**Physics Event**](physics-event.md) | Introduced the physics events in **Cocos Creator 3D**
[**Group Mask**](physics-group-mask.md) | Introduces the use of group and mask in physics filter detection
[**Raycast Detection**](physics-raycast.md) | Introduces the ray detection function of the physics collider
